Automatically forget unwanted Wi-Fi networks from your Android device

Have you ever found your device connected to some strange Wi-Fi network named "guest" or some similarly generic, yet unfortunately very common name? Occasionally you might actually need to connect to such a network, but if you forget to navigate into your device's W-Fi settings and manually "forget" the network after you're finished with it, your device will connect to every other network with same name whether you want it to or not.

Wi-Fi AutoForget allows you to schedule unwanted networks for automatic removal from your system Wi-Fi settings upon disconnection. Wi-Fi AutoForget will show a notification when you connect, allowing you to specify the desired action with a single tap or swipe. When you move out of range, Wi-Fi AutoForget will automatically tell your device to forget it.

Features:
* Single AutoForget
* Permanent AutoForget
* Never AutoForget
* Free
* Open Source
* No ads, spyware, or analytics
