Automatically forget unwanted Wi-Fi networks from your Android device

Have you ever found your device connected to some strange Wi-Fi network named "guest" or some other similar generic, and unfortunately, very common name? Occasionally you might actually need to connect to a network with such a name, but if you forget to navigate into your device's W-Fi settings and manually "forget" the network, your device will connect to every other network with same name whether you want it to or not.

Wi-Fi AutoForget allows you schedule unwanted networks for automatic removal from your system Wi-Fi settings. Wi-Fi AutoForget will show a notification, allowing you to specify the desired action with a single tap or swipe.

Features:
* Single AutoForget
* Permanent AutoForget
* Never AutoForget
* Free
* Open Source
* No ads, spyware, or analytics
